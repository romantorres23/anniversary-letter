    <p>
      I write this as I listen to you study for your MCAT. I just sit here in awh as you continue to blow my mind on a
      daily basis. I've never met someone with so much determination and discipline in my life. You set your sights on
      what you want and just get after it; it's truly inspiring. I just know you're going to be an amazing role model
      for our children.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's already been 4 years since we tied the knot and I have no doubt that deciding to marry you was the best
      decision I have ever made. You make me want to be a better man everyday and push me to be the best that I can be.
      You deserve the world and I vow to continue to do everything in my ability to give you everything you deserve.
      Together we can accomplish all of our goals and live a truly amazing life. I love you.
    </p>
